# Appsmith Overview of Shadow and Page Emporium Project
## By: Aleksandra Tyutyunik, Andrew Sun, Elijah Sandler, Madeleine Jin

Shadow and Page Emporium is a cursed bookstore. They sell your normal average, run of the mill books, except that about half of them are cursed, with varying levels of severity. This database-driven UI allows users to monitor and update the curses they use, books they stock, as well as track sales and ongoing R&D projects.

### Appsmith UI Overview:
The homepage of our Appsmith application offers multiple pages tailored to different user roles within the bookstore. Upon selecting a specific page, such as the 'Researcher Pages,' users are presented with additional options to refine their tasks further. For instance, they can choose to 'Edit Courses,' review 'Course Status,' or access 'Project Information.' Upon selection, Appsmith will navigate users to the relevant page based on their choice.

Our intuitive UI design prioritizes ease of use, allowing users to effortlessly interact with the database for any necessary tasks. Whether editing courses, monitoring course statuses, or accessing project details, users can navigate through the application with simplicity and efficiency, enhancing their overall experience and productivity.
